# ANTARES notebooks
This is a collection of ANTARES notebooks for the LSST enabling science broker workshop. 

# Using Data Lab's Jupyter environment
These notebooks are best used in the NOIRLab Data Lab (https://datalab.noirlab.edu) services. To register to the Data Lab service, please go to "Sign up" at the upper left corner of the Data Lab web page, or "Quick Start" => "Create a new account". 

Once an account is created, please go to "Quick Start" => "Launch a Jupyter notebook" to use the Data Lab's Jupyter environment. Please create a new directory and upload the notebooks and accessory files in this repository. All the required python packages (including antares_client) are pre-installed in Data Lab's JupyterHub.
